This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing collaborative filtering, a popular machine learning technique for building recommendation systems.

Overview
The notebook demonstrates:

Data preprocessing: Preparing the dataset for analysis.
Model implementation: Applying collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
Evaluation: Measuring the performance of the recommendation system.
Collaborative filtering leverages user-item interactions to predict user preferences, enabling tailored recommendations.

Features
User-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
Implementation using Python libraries such as:
numpy
pandas
scipy
Performance evaluation metrics for recommendation systems.
